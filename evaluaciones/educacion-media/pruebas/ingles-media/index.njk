<div class='bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-red-500 my-4 font-serif'>
<strong>The Impact of Climate Change on Biodiversity</strong><br><br>
Climate change poses one of the most significant threats to global biodiversity. Rising temperatures are forcing species to migrate to cooler regions, disrupting ecosystems that have remained stable for millennia. Scientists warn that if current trends continue, up to 30% of plant and animal species could face extinction by 2050. Immediate action is required to mitigate these devastating effects.
</div>

What is the main purpose of this text?`,
    alternativas: [
      "To describe different types of ecosystems around the world",
      "To persuade readers about the urgency of addressing climate change effects on biodiversity",
      "To explain the scientific process of studying animal migration patterns",
      "To provide instructions on how to protect endangered species individually"
    ],
    correcta: 1,
    explicacion: "The text's purpose is persuasive/argumentative. It presents a problem (climate change threat), provides evidence (30% extinction risk), and calls for action ('Immediate action is required'). It's not merely descriptive or instructional."
  },

      "Concerned and urgent, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation",
      "Skeptical and doubtful about the validity of scientific climate research"
    ],
    correcta: 2,
    explicacion: "The author's tone is concerned/urgent, evidenced by phrases like 'most significant threats', 'scientists warn', 'devastating effects', and 'immediate action is required'. This reveals worry and urgency, not neutrality or skepticism."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    dominio: "Domain 1: Reading Comprehension",
    enunciado: `In the phrase "disrupting ecosystems that have remained stable for millennia," what does the word "millennia" mean in context?`,

      "Thousands of years",
      "Millions of years",
      "Decades or generations"
    ],

<strong>From:</strong> sarah.martinez@techcorp.com<br>

      "Specifically remote workers who don't come to the office"

    id: 5,
    dominio: "Domain 1: Reading Comprehension",
    enunciado: `What conclusion can be drawn from the email about the company's previous policy?`,
    alternativas: [
      "The company never allowed any remote work before this change",
      "Employees previously had unlimited work-from-home flexibility",
      "The current policy is less flexible than what employees had before",
      "The company is responding to employee input to improve work conditions"
    ],
    correcta: 3,
    explicacion: "The phrase 'Following recent feedback' indicates the company listened to employees and made changes accordingly. This shows responsiveness to staff input, though we can't definitively know what the previous policy was."

Which persuasive technique is primarily used in this advertisement?`,

    ],
    correcta: 2,
    explicacion: "The ad creates urgency with 'Don't let another day pass', 'Limited stock', 'shop now before it's too late', and leverages seasonal timing ('Beat the heat', 'Summer Sale'). This is a classic scarcity + timeliness persuasion strategy."

    enunciado: `Identify the relationship between these two sentences:

"The experiment failed to produce the expected results. **However**, the data revealed an unexpected pattern in molecular behavior."`,
    alternativas: [
      "Cause and effect - the first event caused the second",

"The conference was actually very informative, despite initial concerns."`,

      "informative (NOT 'informativo' - this IS a true cognate)",
      "initial (NOT 'inicial' - this IS a true cognate)"
    ],
    correcta: 1,
    explicacion: "'Actually' is a false cognate. Spanish speakers often confuse it with 'actualmente' (currently), but 'actually' means 'en realidad/de hecho'. 'Conference' can mean 'conferencia' in some contexts. 'Informative' and 'initial' are true cognates."

      "To verify that all parts were included in the package"

    correcta: 1,
    explicacion: "Step 2's purpose is identification/familiarization before assembly. Users need to know which part is which (using the diagram) before step 3's connection process. This is a preparation step, not assembly or verification."

    dominio: "Domain 1: Reading Comprehension",
    enunciado: `What can be inferred about the product from these assembly instructions?`,

    ],
    correcta: 1,
    explicacion: "The title creates intrigue through paradox - 'failure' typically has negative connotations, but 'benefits' are positive. The word 'hidden' suggests unexpected advantages, which aligns with the content's counterintuitive message about growth through setbacks."

    id: 15,
    dominio: "Domain 1: Reading Comprehension",
    enunciado: `Identify the tone in this product review:

"While the product works as advertised, the customer service experience left much to be desired. Response times were slow, and representatives seemed poorly trained."`,

      "Mixed - positive about product, negative about service",

    ],
    correcta: 2,
    explicacion: "The review shows mixed/balanced tone: 'works as advertised' is positive about the product, BUT 'left much to be desired', 'slow', 'poorly trained' are negative about service. The connector 'while' signals this contrast."
