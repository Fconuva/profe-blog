HISTORY IS NEVER far from China's mind in its trade dispute with America. A few months ago, when negotiations 
looked on track, staunch nationalists warned of echoes with the “unequal treaties” that foreign powers had forced 
upon China in the 19th century. In recent weeks the breakdown in talks has led state propagandists to draw 
comparisons with the Korean war of the 1950s, a bloody struggle between China and America. But the analogy 
that haunts Chinese economists does not involve China itself. They fear a replay of the Plaza Accord of 1985, when 
Japan, under American pressure, tried to resolve trade tensions by pushing the yen higher. That calmed the tensions 
but, most Chinese economists think, at an intolerable price: stagnant Japanese growth for two-plus decades. The 
parallels are imperfect. Dependent on America for security, Japan was constrained in its pushback. The Plaza Accord 
also involved Britain, France and West Germany. Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University has called it “a high-water 
mark of international policy co-ordination”, which is not President Donald Trump’s trademark. The substance was 
different, too. The five countries announced that they wanted the dollar to depreciate and intervened in currency 
markets to make it happen. Within a year the yen soared by nearly 50 % against the dollar. By contrast, currencies 
are just one part of today’s tussle between China and America. Over the past decade China has worked to address 
complaints that the yuan is too low. So there are no calls for appreciation, only demands that China does not weaken 
it to help its exporters.

Read the following text and answer questions 20 to 22. 
The real-estate market has been booming. In high-priced housing markets mom and dad are shelling out cash and 
helping their adult children live the American Dream of homeownership. Parents opening up their wallets and 
isting with home loans have been going on for generations, but the trend is on the rise nowadays. In Boston, I am 
seeing it with first-time homebuyers. I would estimate that close to half of my millennial buyer clients are receiving 
contributions from their parents or grandparents. This arrangement can be tricky at times. There’s more than one way 
to approach it. Here is how my young buyers have navigated purchasing a house alongside their parental units. As a 
real estate agent, I often get stuck in the crosshairs. When it comes to bringing family dynamics into the equation, 
having a solid plan and communicating well are key. First, figure out a financial strategy that makes the most sense. 
Next, have an open discussion about everything before you start the house hunt. Another major point of contention 
is how involved the parents are going to be during the buying process and throughout ownership. It's all about the 
control factor and who gets to call the shots. You want to talk it out prior to sinking time into home shopping. Trust 
me, a home inspection is not an appropriate place for a family feud. The most popular way for parents to get involved 
is by providing gift money. This approach makes the most sense for those who can afford the monthly payments, 
but need help overcoming the upfront costs associated with buying. Most lenders allow borrowers to use gift money 
for a down payment or to foot the bill on closing costs. Parents can also be a non-occupant co-borrower, meaning 
that although they do not live at the property, their names are on the deed. Co-borrowing or in some cases co-signing 
have become an attractive option for families with college students. In lieu of room and board, parents are buying a 
“Kiddie Condo”, a flat or single-family home near campus. Not only does this give young adult students a taste of 
homeownership, it also provides the family with additional income if extra rooms are rented out.

Read the following text and answer questions 23 to 26. 
A smartphone-based relaxation app could help migraine sufferers reduce the number of headaches they get each 
month, a small study suggests. Using the app twice a week was associated with an average of four fewer headache 
days per month, according to the report in Nature Digital Medicine. “Migraine is now the second most disabling 
condition in terms of disability-adjusted years lost,” said lead author Dr. Mia Minen of NYU Langone Health in 
New York City. 
Migraines affect about 1 in 6 adults in the U.S., with women most at risk. 
“Previous research has shown that the best treatment for preventing migraine is a combination of migraine 
medication and behavioral therapy,” Minen told Reuters Health by email. However, “patients have significant 
difficulty accessing these safe, top evidence-based treatments 
” 
Minen and colleagues created RELAXaHEAD, an app based on the technique of progressive muscle relaxation, a 
proven method of migraine prevention, the authors note. The study team analyzed whether patients recruited from 
a neurology clinic would use the app regularly and whether they’d have fewer headache days. 
During the study, 51 patients in their 30s and 40s who typically had 13 or more headache days per month were asked 
to complete a daily headache diary and to do progressive muscle relaxation with the app for 20 minutes a day for 
90 days. Nearly one third of the participants were considered to have severe migraine disability when they enrolled, 
meaning they had missed considerable amounts of work, school and family activities due to the headaches. 
On average, participants used the app on 22 days per month, for about 11 minutes per day. Roughly half used it once 
per week and a third used it two or more times per week. Overall, those who used the app twice per week had four 
fewer headache days the following month, and those who used it once per week had two fewer headaches days. Use 
of the app tended to drop over time. 
Patients with higher depression scores were less likely to use the daily headache diary, and those with higher anxiety 
scores were more likely to use it. “Research here is important to enable therapeutically effective and safe smartphone 
apps. Lots of apps are offered that are not based on any scientific evidence,” said Thomas Dresler of the University 
of Tuebingen in Germany, who wasn’t involved in the study. 
“There are a lot of migraine apps out there, but customers need to know that the availability of an app per se 
does not guarantee effectiveness, safety or the developers” adherence to specific quality standards;” Dresler said 
by email.

Read the following text and answer questions 27 and 28. 
Then there is the fact that, as Adam Smith observed nearly 250 years ago, “People of the same trade seldom 
meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, 
or in some contrivance to raise prices” The fewer businesses engaged in the same trade, the easier it is to 
collude, either tacitly or explicitly and illegally. And in most trades there are many fewer businesses today: 
hospitals, beer, railroads, trucking, retail, technology, airlines, and most other categories of the economy. In 
certain industries this may have been a natural outgrowth of economies of scale, but it is hard to not also see 
that increased government-sponsored monopolies, through stronger intellectual-property protections, and reduced 
antitrust enforcement have also played an important role. The less cited second half of Smith's quote is no less 
important: “[the law] ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary. A 
regulation which obliges all those of the same trade in a particular town to enter their names and places of abode 
in a public register, facilitates such assemblies. . .”. The regulations that facilitate collusion and the perpetuation of 
economic rents do not just come from nowhere.

Read the following text and answer questions 29 to 31. 
1. Americans bought 7.3 million SUVs in 2017, a record 43 
% of new car sales in the U.S. The mighty SUV 
has become the king of American roads! Many current SUV models showed off facelifts, new tech, and sporty 
performance packages at the New York Auto International Show (NYIAS). The name of the game is more tech, 
more safety, a sportier ride, and more interior room. Every new SUV debuting at the NYTAS has a longer wheelbase 
and more standard intelligent safety systems. 
2. The RAV4 was the best-selling Toyota and non-pickup-truck in the country in 2017, with just over 400,000 
units sold. Toyota is hoping to build on that success with a completely fresh, athletic looking RAV4 in 2019. The 
fifth-generation 2019 RAV4 will offer a larger interior, more luxury options, and an all-new chiselled look. Expect 
to see the 2019 RAV4 hit dealer lots in late 2018, with hybrid models coming in early 2019. 
3. It seems Subaru and Toyota had similar thoughts when redesigning their flagship compact SUVs. The 2019 
Subaru Forester is also a fifth generation of the nameplate, offers a wheelbase that is 1.2 inches longer, comes with 
more intelligent safety features standard, and should hit dealer lots late this year. The extra wheelbase length, boxy 
design, and some other thoughtful upgrades will make the latest Forester the roomiest compact SUV on the market. 
The rear gate opening is one of the widest on the market, at 51.2 inches. That is a full 5.3 inches more than the 
outgoing Forester. Getting your gear in and out of this SUV should be a lot easier. 
4. While just a concept at this point, we can’t overlook the debut of the Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport Concept. It is 
very close to the small SUV that you can expect from VW's Chattanooga, Tenn., factory. Expect the vehicle at dealer 
lots sometime next year. The Atlas Cross Sport is a smaller version of the Atlas —the same chassis and wheelbase. 
Butitis 7.5 inches shorter overall. It offers seating for five and a 355 hp plug-in hybrid system featuring two electric 
motors and a 3.6L V6. In theory, that combo should be good for 130 mph top speed and 0 to 60 in around 5.4 seconds 
and it has a 26-mile all-electric range. A massive 12.3-inch digital cockpit dominates the dashboard. An additional 
10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment screen is mounted in the centre console. Other controls are kept to a minimum 
for a clean, futuristic cockpit design.

Read the following text and answer questions 32 to 34. 
Alexis Sánchez - the 31-year-old - has used Instagram to tell his side of the story about his failed move to Old 
Trafford in 2018. Sánchez endured a torrid spell after signing under José Mourinho, scoring five goals in 45 
appearances before being loaned to Internazionale last season and joining them on a free this summer. 
“T want to tell you about my period at United, about many things that were said and that made me look bad,” said 
Sánchez. “I got the opportunity to go to United and it seemed tempting to me. It was something nice for me, because, 
when I was a kid, I liked that club a lot. 
“Tended up signing without much information about what was happening in the move. The first days that I was with 
my colleagues, sometimes there are things that you do not realise until you arrive.” 
“The first training I had I realised many things. I came home and I told my representative: ‘Can’t the contract be 
terminated to return to Arsenal?” They start laughing and I told them that something did not sit right with me. It [the 
contract] had already been signed” 
Sánchez arrived at United in the January window as the club's top-earner and he feels he became a scapegoat for 
the team's failure. 
“Tm telling you my experience; the journalists at times would speak without knowing the facts and it hurt, they 
had no idea what was going on inside the club,” the Chilean forward said. “They said it was my fault, and this, and 
that, but sometimes a player depends on the environment, the family that is created around him, and I think that in 
that moment we weren’t really a family. And that translated onto the pitch, and since there needed to be someone to 
blame, they blamed me.” 
Sánchez recalled being left out of the matchday squad by Mourinho against West Ham in September 2018. “I wasn’t 
picked,” he said. “That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me and I said it couldn’t be possible. To 
go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house and I was 
very sad. The next day I trained in a double shift, because I love what I do” 
United lost to West Ham and Mourinho was sacked months later. Sánchez then spoke to Ole Gunnar Solskjeer about 
leaving the club. “I told him that I needed to take a breather, and the opportunity to go to Inter. He told me that yes, 
there was no problem.”

lesson by telling a short traditional story called “The Mirror of Matsuyama” where students had to 
pay attention to details to discover what country it came from. After the storytelling, they actively 
participated naming details to finally come up with “Japan.” Then he asked them: “Can you name 
a traditional story from your own countries?” A Chilean student answered: “El roto que engañó al 
diablo,” another one from Perú stated: “El zorro y el cuy,” and another one from Colombia said: “La

ﬂ A teacher of 10th Grade decided to evaluate Unit 4 Sustainable Development by asking students to 
write two descriptive texts about environmental issues that affect their communities. In this unit, he 
pursued OA15: “To write, to analyze, to express opinions or to narrate using different connectors.” 
After checking the first text, the teacher noticed some frequent mistakes: many students forgot to 
use connectors “so” and “because” properly. So he organized a feedback session where, on the one 
hand, he congratulated students for their achievements in terms of punctuation and vocabulary use 
and, on the other hand, he pointed out the lack of connectors. Students had time to clarify their own 
doubts. When checking the second text, he noticed that some students still made mistakes concerning 
the correct use of linking words and therefore, he realized that his feedback session had not been as 
effective as he thought it would be. 
Based on the previous context, which option represents the reason why the teacher's feedback was 
not effective enough? 
A Because he forgot to provide personal feedback on mistakes. 
B Because he only praised students who used connectors correctly. 
C Because he did not provide written correction to individual students. 
D Because he neither showed students how to improve mistakes nor did he provide examples. 
A 9th Grade teacher has just got her students thinking about “green issues”, given them a chance

clear up any major confusion. Then, they listen to the recording a second time. 
Which of the following class stages would most accurately represent the preceding classroom 
situation? 
A Feedback stage. 
B 
Motivation stage. 
C Post-listening stage. 
D While-listening stage.

ﬂ An English teacher is preparing a listening comprehension lesson for 9th Grade A, where most of the 
students belong to different sport teams of the school. Even though they are very good at reading, 
their EFL oral and written productions are very poor. Most of the time, they get nervous if they have 
to read a text aloud, talk in public or even simulate an interview. They are only able to answer yes/no 
questions and when they have to produce a written text, their production lacks coherence. Considering 
his students' interests and likes, the teacher has decided to include an audio text about sports to have 
pupils identify fans' emotional reactions toward difficult matches. To do so, he starts the lesson by 
explaining and exemplifying that the same utterances can have different meanings depending on the 
intonation used. He also stresses that when saying a sentence not only information is transmitted but 
also an intention is behind it. 
Considering the previous classroom situation, which option represents a strategy the teacher can 
include in his lesson to achieve the mentioned objective? 
A Tohave students recognize the feelings described by a sequence of sentences listened to about 
an audience attending a soccer match. 
B Tohave students select from a list of 20 words expressed aloud the ones associated with soccer, 
explaining the reason of their selection. 
C Tohave students infer the end of a conversation between two friends attending a soccer match, 
based on the beginning of the conversation listened to. 
D To have students complete short dialogues about an English soccer team, with key vocabulary 
related to feelings, based on what they have listened to, to role-play it later in front of the class.

50) A teacher of 10th Grade is designing a listening lesson within the Unit Technology and Its Effects based 
on the Task-Based Learning Approach. In this lesson, he pursues OA7: “To react to read and listened 
texts through oral reports, discussions or group conversations to express feelings or points of view.” 
He is aware that his students' language skills are still weak and need support and extra training. So he 
decides to expose students to a listening passage about online shopping. He asks them to look up key 
vocabulary in dictionaries and then identify specific ideas to answer Wh-comprehension questions. 
Which of the following activities can be included next in this lesson, so that it is based on the 
Task-Based Learning Approach?

A teacher of 10th Grade is designing the Unit Outstanding Persons. He is working with OA 7: “To 
react to read or listened texts by participating in oral reports, discussions or group conversations.” In 
previous units, he noticed that students had different levels of language achievement: while some of 
them had an excellent command of productive skills creating with fluency and accuracy written and 
spoken messages, others tended to need constant scaffolding from him. In this unit, he is designing 
and adapting activities considering his students' different levels of language command, though he 
knows it is going to be difficult to carry them out simultaneously. 
According to the previous context, which option represents a coherent evaluation instrument that 
allows the teacher to get information to sort this problem out?
